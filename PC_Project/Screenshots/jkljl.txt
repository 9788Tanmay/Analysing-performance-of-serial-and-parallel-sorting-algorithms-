	A parallel quicksort program with threads of t.
	The idea is:
		1. partition array equally (with chunk_size = size / p) for each process
		2. do local quicksort in each thread (time complexity is O((n/p) * log(n/p)))
		3. merge all local sorted parts in a binary tree (with depth log(p))




	
The algorithm so far is suitable for a shared memory
implementation. 
 Distribute the array to be sorted
 Broadcast a pivot among p processes
 Each partitions n/p elements in O(n/p)
 The re-arrangement of lower and upper parts involves
communication
 Need to know where a process should send its Si and Li
parts
 Once determined, data gets exchanged
